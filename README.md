## About the Game
The game was written in Python using the pygame library. It also uses SQLAlchemy to store user save data in a database. At this moment, it serves as a demo to showcase its functionality.

## Features
- **Immersive Storyline**: Follow a gripping narrative that unfolds based on the choices you make.
- **Multiple Endings**: Different choices lead to different outcomes, providing replay value.
- **Perma Death**: If you die, your current character's save games are permanently deleted.
- **Resolution Changes**: Seamlessly change the game's resolution from the main menu. All calculations such as collisions, map point markers, character movement, buttons, backgrounds, or text will accommodate the change.
- **2D Animations**: Includes moving backgrounds, shadows, moving clouds, character walking, and button animations.
- **Enemies That Chase the Character**: Enemies will try to catch you while on the world map. If they do, you're dead.
- **Enemies That Multiply**: Every 10 seconds, a new enemy will spawn and chase you, so think fast.
